\missionheading{Scramble}

At the start of the event, each player is grouped into an alliance.
Each player then selects a legacy.

To Cataclysm: If multiple players within an alliance have units
controlling a single objective then they are each considered to hold
it for individual scoring purposes.

\missionheading{Cataclysm}

The primary objective markers are pieces of \emph{The Scythe of Unbound Light}.

Some your forces have already been able to document or otherwise
aren't as valuable.  Some have been outright destroyed and are only
minimally useful.  Some are believed to be extremely valuable,
yielding great knowledge even in their fragmented form.
