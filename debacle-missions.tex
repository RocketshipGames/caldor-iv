\missionheading{Army Construction}

Armies must be selected to at most~1500 points.  All up to date
sources\footnote{Partial list maintained by Redcap's Corner and PAGE:
  \url{http://bit.ly/1uWkFHz}} are permitted.  No requirements or
constraints are placed on detachments or force organizations.  Forge
World units and armies eligible for standard \emph{Warhammer 40,000}
are permitted.

Models need not be painted, but objective painting scores will be
applied to reward finished armies.

Models must be WYSIWYG, but identifiable and thoughtful conversions
are welcome.  Contact the tournament organizer(s) beforehand about any
uncertain models.  ``Counts-as'' proxies and undistinguishable or
confusing stand-ins are not permitted.

\missionheading{Supporting Materials}

You must have an official, legal, complete physical or digital copy on
hand for all army, unit, and other sources you are using.  You should
bring printed copies of relevant pages of any electronic sources.
Don't forget errata and FAQs for your sources.\footnote{Available from
  The Black Library:
  \url{http://www.blacklibrary.com/faqs-and-errata.html}}

You must bring any dice, templates, and markers you need to facilitate
playing your army, as well as five typed copies of your army roster
with points listed.


\missionheading{Startup Sequence}
Each mission will use the following setup process:

\begin{itemize}\shortlist
\item Clarify terrain and exchange lists

\item Determine warlord traits, then psychic powers, and then other
  pre-game effects and choices

\item D6 roll off to select deployment zones

\item Place primary objective markers

\item D6 roll off to choose first or second deployment

\item Deploy main armies in that order

\item Deploy any Infiltrators (pg. 167)

\item Secretly choose and record secondary objectives from the options
  listed for the mission

\item Make any Scout redeployments (pg. 171)

\item Reveal secondary objectives

\item First to deploy chooses to play first or second

\item Seize the Initiative roll, if desired

%\item \emph{Fight!}
\end{itemize}

\missionheading{Mission Rules}%

The following special rules will be applied to each mission, in
addition to any given by the mission definition or otherwise
specified, e.g., for a particular table.

\missionsubheading{Easy Recon.}  Players add~+1 to their roll to
choose first or second deployment for each superheavy vehicle or
gargantuan creature in the opposing army.

\missionsubheading{Reserves.} As defined on page~135 of the main
\emph{Warhammer 40,000} rulebook.

\missionsubheading{Seize the Initiative.} As defined on page~132 of
the main \emph{Warhammer 40,000} rulebook.

\missionsubheading{Variable Game Length.} As defined on page~133 of
the main \emph{Warhammer 40,000} rulebook.

\missionsubheading{All In.}  Units/models in reserve at game end count
as completely destroyed/removed as a casualty.

\missionheading{Scoring}%

Match results are determined by scoring primary, secondary, and
tertiary objectives as given for each mission.  Any unit or faction
specific rules granting victory points \emph{to a player's opponent}
also apply.

The winner of a match is the player with the most victory points.
Ties are broken in favor of the player with the most army points on
the table at game end, including embarked units and claimed
fortifications.

Tournament standings are determined first by win/loss records and then
the sum total victory points achieved across all three missions.  No
more than~20 victory points may be earned per mission toward these
standings, though any additional victory points won do count toward
determining the match winner.

\missiontitle{Mission 1: Contact}

\centerline{\emph{Armies collide as the vanguards of opposing sides
    make contact in the burgeoning planetary war.}}

\missionheading{Table Setup}

Deployment zones are \textbf{Vanguard Strike}, as defined on page~131
of the main \emph{Warhammer 40,000} rulebook.  Vanguard Strike may be
approximated by deploying within a 33.5'' x 50'' table corner
triangle.  The player that wins the zone roll off may pick any of the
four corners, and the other player takes that diagonally opposite.

\bigskip%
After determining deployment zones, place one primary objective marker
at the center of the table and one at each of the two table quadrant
centers outside the deployment zones, i.e., 18'' from the short table
edge and 12'' from the long table edge in the corners opposite the
deployment zones.  There are thus three primary objective markers
along the diagonal dividing the no man's land between the two
deployment zones.

\missionheading{Mission Specific Rules}

The following mission specific rules apply, in addition to those
applied to all missions in this pack.

\missionsubheading{Nightfighting.}  All units have Stealth on Turn 1.

% As defined on page~135 of the main
% \emph{Warhammer 40,000} rulebook.


\missionheading{Scoring}

This mission is scored by objectives achieved, as follows.

\missionsubheading{Primary Objectives.} At the conclusion of the game,
players score~3 victory points for each primary objective marker they
control, as defined by the standard rules (page~134 of the main
rulebook).


\missionsubheading{Secondary Objectives.}

After deployment, both players simultaneously choose and then reveal a
single secondary objective for themselves from the list below.  Any
necessary selections are chosen and then revealed with the objective
unless noted otherwise.  \underline{No more than~6 victory points may
  be earned via any secondary.}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Seek and Destroy.}  Choose and declare a Battlefield
  Role other than Troop.  Score~2 victory points for each enemy unit
  of this role completely destroyed or falling back at the end of the
  game.

\item \textbf{Seize Ground.}  Choose two terrain pieces not in your
  deployment zone.  Do not declare these now, but do secretly record
  your selection unambiguously!  Reveal these at game end and score~3
  victory points for each piece that you control, treating them as
  objective markers.  Note that this means a single unit cannot claim
  both a primary objective marker and a terrain piece simultaneously.

\item \textbf{Reconnaissance.}  At the end of the game, score~2
  victory points for each friendly scoring unit with the Scout or
  Infiltrate USR completely within 12'' of your opponent's table edge.

\end{itemize}


\missionsubheading{Tertiary Objectives.}  Both players apply all of
the following tertiary objectives.  \underline{No more than~5 total
  victory} \underline{points may be earned by a player across all of
  the tertiary objectives.}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Slay the Warlord.}  If the opposing army has a Lord of
  War character or a Warlord of any type and either has been removed
  as a casualty or is falling back at the end of the game, score~2
  victory points.

\item \textbf{Linebreaker.}  Score~2 victory points if a model from
  any friendly scoring unit is completely within 12'' of your
  opponent's table edge.

\item \textbf{First Blood.}  As defined on page~133 of the main
  \emph{Warhammer 40,000} rulebook.

\item \textbf{Victory Through Attrition.}  Score~1 victory point for
  each unsaved hull point or wound taken from any opposing superheavy
  vehicle or gargantuan creature by any means, including explosions
  and other indirect effects.  These points are earned at the end of
  any phase in which such damage occurs, and thus include any repaired
  or regenerated later.
\end{itemize}

\missiontitle{Mission 2: Ground At Any Cost}

\centerline{\emph{Warriors lock into combat as they desperately fight
    to carve out space for their army on the battlefield.}}

\missionheading{Table Setup}

Deployment zones are \textbf{Dawn of War}, as on page~131 of the
\emph{Warhammer 40,000} rulebook (12'' long edges).

\bigskip%
After determining deployment zones, six primary objective markers are
put down.  Each player receives three markers which they alternate
placing, beginning with the winner of a D6 roll off, in the following
order:

\begin{itemize}
\item Your first marker is worth~3 victory points and must be placed
  in either deployment zone.

\item Your second marker is worth~2 victory points and must be placed
  in the opposite zone from your first.

\item Your third marker must be placed on the table centerline, i.e.,
  anywhere 24'' from both long edges.
\end{itemize}

All other placement rules apply as given on page~134 of the main
\emph{Warhammer 40,000} rulebook.  After placement, randomly select
one of the two centerline markers to be worth~4 victory points.  The
other centerline marker is worth~1 victory point.  Make sure to
unambiguously record the value of all markers.
